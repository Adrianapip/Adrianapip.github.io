Summary: How this site exists
Draft: True

In my recent explorations of types of sites to create: I've pretty much done them all. I've had a wordpress site, I have a squarespace site, I'm working on a complete front-to-back site, and I have this one.

It just depends on the purpose of you site. This one serves purely a journalistic purpose - presenting information that is linked, but really requires no processing information other than on the surface html.

I also have a squarespace site, which I love. I've always felt lacking in design capability. Some people have it, some people I don't. I'm one of the latter. Squarespace is an all-in-one package for design and content right out of the box. Maintaining it is a bit more expensive at about $8 a month, but for me it's worth it. The templates are so beautiful that I have trouble choosing one, and for my business it serves it's purpose. I needed something new and shiney to add my content too, which is the focus of my consultantcy. In that case I have no desire to change it - my main focus on that area is to focus on my science, on my writing and tutorials.

On the other hand, such a site here would be lovely, but my goal is to document and present my learning, so I chose to go with a very simple static site generator - Pelican. I just really love Python so it seemed like the most rational choice. It requires a little knowledge of how Python works but for the most part it's so well documented that almost every problem is google-able.
