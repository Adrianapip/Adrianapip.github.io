Summary: Why this site exists

I've always wanted a central location for notes on my projects for a while. When I worked in a lab, there was the almighty Lab Notebook. Covered in coffee stains, reagents, and goodness knows what else (don't ask I worked with mice üêÅ) these notebooks were handwritten time capsules that contained little bits of your past. 

Going back and reading it most of the time is like: 'what the heck was I thinking, why did I ...' ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Handwritten notebooks seem archiac at first. Passed down through centuries of scientists, it's required for good reason. 

You can't really move forward unless you learn from the (mistakes and deep analysis) of the past. 

Plus, what person can remember every. single. little. detail. 

Recently I've been feeling a common thread in my current work. Something I should keep record of.  

I typically categorize the work by the time of day it's done: 

1. During the day I consult (mainly science-y stuff) for my business. It could be administrative nonsense, heavy research/writing, or compuational work. 

2. In the evenings I try to spend time on side projects, which currently is building a baking app. (The more delicious output of this project takes place on the weekends, which entails loads of actual baking in my kitchen.) 

In other words, I want to document the 'backend', which primarily consists of programming, designing, and organizing, of the 'frontend' of my work, which is what people see: my genomics computational stuff, my analytics blog, my baking app. 

There is all this underlying computational/coding work of which I am largely self-taught. That means I make lots of mistakes. Like 99% of the time.  

I'm learning as I go. I actually love (like really, love love love) learning but, it is something of a mixed blessing. I will forgo the timeline of a project if I can simply linger on a topic for a little while to make sure I understand every aspect of it. That's where this place comes in handy - sharing what I learned, what I messed up, how I fixed stuff.
