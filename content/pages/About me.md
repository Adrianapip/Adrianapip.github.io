Hello! I'm Adriana. I'm a scientific consultant at [Dranalytics](https://www.dranalytyics.co) working on computional-based research for medical diagnostics.

I'm also a self-taught coder and enjoying working on (probably too) many projects simultaneously, largely in Python.  

This site is a catchall for all the stuff that takes up space in my brain, including my thoughts on: recent reads, baking adventures, various scientific ideas, and programming snippets.
