Hello, I'm Adriana. I work mainly on computational-based research that develops and builds medical diagnostics. I'm currently a scientific consultant at [Dranalytics](https://www.dranalytyics.co).

I'm a self-taught coder and love exploring different ways that technology can positively influence science and, in general, life. 

Here you can find all the current things I'm working on, thinking about, or reading.
